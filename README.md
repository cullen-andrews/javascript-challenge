Level 1 was very easy because of the starter code, and because of the class lessons, which had code which was easy to transfer with only slight modifications.

Level 2 was not quite as easy (but still easy). I had to figure out more specifics of how the syntax of the d3 code was working, in order to apply it to several different filtering fields, so it was a valuable lesson.
