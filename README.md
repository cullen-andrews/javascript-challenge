Level 1 was very easy because of the starter code, and because of the class lessons, which had code which was easy to transfer with only slight modifications.

Level 2 was not quite as easy (but still easy). I had to figure out more specifics of how the syntax of the d3 code was working, in order to apply it to several different filtering fields, so it was a valuable lesson.

The way I have it now, you have to enter all 5 fields to get a search result. I do not find it satisfactory, and if I would want to have it work so that it could search if the user enters only a subset of the fields listed.
